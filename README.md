Fancy, contextual Elite: Dangerous tools

## Features

Elite MFD tracks your current system by enabling Verbose Logging. This makes it more convenient to use various popular E:D tools:

- Trade calculation relative to current system/station
- Search for nearby stations matching various criteria
- Navigation/routing with turn-by-turn narration
- Automatic memorization of various search parameters like ship size, jump range, and cash available

The MFD also provides other convenience tools:

- Macro system, with a default for requesting landing permission
- Login and logout with the press of a button

## Installation

For now, clone the repo somewhere, then install the UI stuff using

    cd resources/public && bower install

Pre-built standalone jars may be provided in [Releases](https://github.com/dhleong/elite-mfd/releases) at some point.

## Usage

For development, just use [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/):

    lein run

For faster startup, you can build a static jar using:

    lein uberjar

Static jars can be launched with [Launch4J](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) in Windows, if that's what you're into.

Once the server is running, open a web browser from your preferred device pointing to the computer's IP and port `9876`, eg: if your computer has the LAN IP address `192.168.1.6`, open `http://192.168.1.6:9876`.
